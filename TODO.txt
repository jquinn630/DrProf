Greek Dungeon
- Add statues/columns/decorations
- replace capsule with lightning obj
- lightning gate (need to power to get out)
	- Or targets across a gap

	- It would be cool to have a second level that involved jumping across all the columns in the main room
		- maybe the lightning can be used to turn on an elevator?

Norse Temple
-Fix Hammer Controls
-Implement three puzzle rooms and door
	-jumping puzzle
	-hammer puzzle

Playability
- Better overlay (HUD, powerups, minimap?, etc)
- add pointer for where player is looking (for aiming stuffs)
- Something doesn't feel right about the movement controls, but I can't put my finger on it...
-We need to do something about his jumping/rigidbody in general on the character.  Maybe a CharacterController?  Rigidbody sucks.
